        <h2>Sandy Faces - Sandringham Community Centre</h2>
        <p>Sandy Faces was a self-guided project I with the <a href="https://www.sandybeach.org.au/"> Sandringham Community Centre</a>. Their Young at Heart weekly historical group was collecting personal stories from each of the members for an online platform that would eventually be shared with loved ones. I wanted to create some visual assets that would help to bring their stories to life in a dramatic and exciting way so we held some portrait sessions at the centre and I took photos while they told their stories. It was a beauitful event and the images were exhibited at the Centre with a permanent copy of their favourite shot provided as a momento of the occasion.
